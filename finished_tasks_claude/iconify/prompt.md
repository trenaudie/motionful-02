can you just use the iconify api to create a go tool in tools/fetch_iconify that will fetch the icon that besrt matches the query, and download it to the public/assets/pngs dir. 
Eg. 
query: "dog"
output: <successful downloading of the dog iconify component to the public/assets/pngs  dir as "dog.png" >
