# YouTube Video Script: The Case for Bitcoin — Facts, Stats & The Road to $1 Million

## [Opening Scene]

[Graphic: Bitcoin soaring above skyscrapers. Upbeat, dramatic music.]

**Narrator:**  
“Two of Wall Street’s biggest Bitcoin bulls just dropped the same jaw-dropping prediction: Bitcoin to $1 million per coin. But there’s a story behind the numbers that mainstream media is missing. Let’s dive into the facts.”

## [Scene 1: The Big Predictions]

[Cut to TV clips of Tom Lee and Samson Mow.]

**Voiceover:**  
“Tom Lee from Fundstrat isn’t just guessing. He’s done the math. If Bitcoin grabs just 25% of gold’s market cap—a $20 trillion pool—it would translate to about $250,000 per Bitcoin. If it matches gold fully, that’s over $1 million per coin.”

**On-Screen Text:**
- *Gold above-ground value: ~$20 trillion*
- *25% = $5 trillion Bitcoin market cap (~$250k/BTC)*
- *100% = $20 trillion market cap (~$1M/BTC)*

**Voiceover:**  
“And then there’s Samson Mow, who isn’t shy about big numbers either—he sees $500,000 or even $1 million ‘very possible’ within the next year, all thanks to a wave of institutional and government adoption.”

## [Scene 2: Inflation and Real Value]

[Show charts adjusting 2021 Bitcoin high for inflation.]

**Voiceover:**  
“Here’s a rarely-discussed fact: If you adjust the $69,000 all-time high from 2021 for inflation, its real value today is at least $75,700—and maybe over $80,000, given the 13-16% U.S. inflation since 2021. So even $100,000 Bitcoin in 2025 is just ‘keeping pace’ with the dollar’s declining value.”

**On-Screen Text:**  
- *2021 BTC high: $69,000*
- *2025 inflation-adjusted: $75,700–$80,000*
- *Cumulative U.S. inflation: 13–16% since 2021*

## [Scene 3: Institutional Adoption — The Elephant in the Room]

[Cut to MicroStrategy headquarters, then Tesla’s gigafactory. Fade in trading screens with Bitcoin ETF tickers.]

**Voiceover:**  
“Look who’s buying up the supply:  
- MicroStrategy now owns over 568,000 bitcoins—more than $59 billion worth.  
- Tesla sits on 11,509 BTC, worth over $1.2 billion—after rebounding from a major selloff.  
- In just one week this July, 21 different companies added $810 million worth of Bitcoin to their treasuries.”

**On-Screen Stats:**  
- *MicroStrategy: 568,840 BTC ($59.2B, May 2025)*
- *Tesla: 11,509 BTC ($1.2B, Q2 2025)*
- *Corporate Bitcoin buys: $810M, July 2025*

**Voiceover:**  
“Institutional investors aren’t dabbling—they’re accumulating. ETFs and even entire states and nations are moving in, creating a demand crunch.”

## [Scene 4: Retail Investors Are Getting Left Behind]

[Clips: News of Bitcoin rallies, excited retail crowds entering the market after new all-time highs.]

**Voiceover:**  
“History shows regular investors hesitate at $80,000 or $90,000, but can’t resist at $200,000. This FOMO is exactly what institutions are counting on—they’re buying when others are cautious, then waiting for retail hype to drive the next leg up.”

## [Scene 5: Media Disconnect and The Bigger Picture]

[Montage: Financial news headlines—“Crypto Under Pressure” vs. “Bitcoin ETF Record Flows”]

**Voiceover:**  
“While mainstream media focuses on volatility and quick price swings, the underlying data tells a different story. As of late July 2025, Bitcoin is trading around $118,000—a price that’s only a modest real gain over the 2021 top when inflation is considered.”

**On-Screen Text:**  
- *Bitcoin price: $117,000–$119,000, July 2025*
- *Majority of supply now in institutional hands*

**Voiceover:**  
“Both Tom Lee and Samson Mow argue: We are seeing a revaluation of Bitcoin toward gold’s multi-trillion-dollar status. Institutional adoption is unprecedented, and the next wave could price out everyday investors.”

## [Closing Argument]

[Dynamic animation: Bitcoin racing past gold bars, charts climbing.]

**Narrator:**  
“The facts are clear:  
- Institutional adoption is growing fast.  
- Inflation is eating away at old highs.  
- Mainstream coverage misses the shift underway.”

**Narrator:**  
“Whether you believe a $1 million Bitcoin is hype or destiny, the numbers say a structural shift is happening. The only question: will you be part of it, or watching from the sidelines?”
