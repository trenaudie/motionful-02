To achieve your goal—turning raw video transcripts into a structured **news commentary script + editing guide**—you’ll need a **prompt** that guides your automation agent to:

1. **Respect source visibility and editorial voice boundaries** (e.g. use *raw footage*, exclude commentary).
2. **Compose a structured, alternating script** that blends your own commentary with **relevant video segments**.
3. **Output timestamp-based clips** with a meaningful structure and filenames.

Here’s a high-quality, detailed prompt you can use as a base:

---

## 📝 **Prompt: Transcripts → Storyline + Timestamps + Script Structure**

> **You are an editorial video assistant that helps create structured, timestamp-annotated storylines from video transcripts.** The final product is a YouTube news-style video that blends **my own commentary** (as a pundit/commentator) with **raw moments** extracted from source videos.

---

### 🎯 **Your Goal**

Create a **structured video storyline** that alternates between:

* **My own scripted commentary** (which I will record later)
* **Clips from the source videos**, using only *raw footage* (e.g. interviews, public statements, live footage) and **excluding third-party commentary** unless visually relevant

---

### 📁 Inputs:

You are given transcripts of 3 news videos (e.g., Fox News, BBC, MSNBC) with timestamps.

* The transcripts are extracted directly from the `videos_raw` folder.
* Each transcript includes timestamps and speaker info (if available).
* Assume the video filenames match the transcript filenames.

---

### 📤 Output Requirements:

1. **Final Structured Script** in the following format:

   ```yaml
   - type: "commentary"
     text: "<Your own commentary sentence or paragraph here>"
   - type: "clip"
     source: "video_filename_01.mp4"
     start: "00:01:23"
     end: "00:01:39"
     summary: "Trump walks into courthouse, says 'this is a witch hunt'"
     visual_relevance: "high"  # Indicates this is a good visual moment to show
   - type: "commentary"
     text: "<Next point I want to make as a pundit>"
   - type: "clip"
     source: "video_filename_02.mp4"
     start: "00:04:01"
     end: "00:04:18"
     summary: "Epstein shown with political figures"
   ```

2. **Filename schema**:
   Output clipped video segments will be named using:

   ```
   clip_XX_<short_summary_slug>.mp4
   ```

   For example:

   ```
   clip_01_trump_courtroom.mp4
   clip_02_epstein_meeting.mp4
   ```

### 🎛️ Key Editorial Guidelines

* ✅ Use only the **raw footage** from news videos (e.g., statements, events, witness video, official recordings).

* ❌ Exclude any **third-party commentary**, **voiceovers**, or **studio journalist narration**, unless:

  * The **visual** is useful (e.g. the journalist board is shown once to orient the viewer).
  * You include only the **visual**, not the commentary audio.

* 🎯 Prioritize **visually rich or dramatic moments** over static or redundant scenes.

* 🧩 The storyline should be **coherent and argumentative**: use my commentary to make sense of or question the raw events.

* 🕹️ Segment the videos in **chronological or thematic order** that supports your narrative.

* 💬 When inserting a clip, include a **short text summary of what is happening**, not a verbatim line.
