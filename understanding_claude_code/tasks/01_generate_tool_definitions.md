# Generate Tool Definitions Task Summary

## Overview
Created a Python script to extract tool definitions and tool calls from Claude Code JSON logs for analysis and documentation purposes.

## What Was Done

### 1. Initial Analysis
- Examined the structure of `request_to_claude_code.json`
- Identified that it contains both:
  - Tool definitions in `request.body.tools[]` array
  - Actual tool usage in assistant messages as `tool_use` objects

### 2. Python Script Development
Created `extract_tool_calls.py` with the following functions:

#### `extract_tool_calls(json_data)`
- Extracts actual tool usage from assistant messages
- Searches for `type: "tool_use"` objects in message content
- Returns list of tool invocations made during the conversation

#### `extract_tool_definitions(json_data)`
- Extracts tool specifications from the `tools` array in request body
- Contains full tool schemas including:
  - Tool name and description
  - Input parameters and types
  - Usage instructions
  - Examples and constraints

#### `write_jsonl(data, output_file)`
- Writes extracted data to JSONL format (one JSON object per line)
- Enables easy processing with command-line tools

### 3. Output Files Generated

#### `tool_calls.jsonl`
- Contains 1 actual tool call (Read tool)
- Shows how tools were invoked during the conversation
- Includes tool name, ID, and input parameters

#### `tool_definitions.jsonl`
- Contains 17 tool definitions available to Claude Code
- Includes comprehensive specifications for tools like:
  - **Bash**: Execute shell commands
  - **Read/Write/Edit**: File manipulation
  - **MultiEdit**: Batch file edits
  - **Glob/Grep**: File search and pattern matching
  - **TodoWrite**: Task management
  - **WebFetch/WebSearch**: Internet access
  - **NotebookRead/NotebookEdit**: Jupyter notebook support
  - **Task**: Launch specialized agents
  - **MCP tools**: IDE integration (diagnostics, code execution)

### 4. Key Insights Discovered
- Claude Code has access to 17 different tool types
- Tools cover file operations, web access, task management, and IDE integration
- Each tool has detailed input schemas and usage constraints
- The system separates tool definitions (what's available) from tool calls (what's actually used)

## Usage
```bash
cd understanding_claude_code
python extract_tool_calls.py
```

This analysis provides a comprehensive view of Claude Code's tool ecosystem and how it processes requests.
